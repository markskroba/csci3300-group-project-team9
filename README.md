# Group 9 Sprint 1

In Sprint 1, our group aimed to allow the user to add questions to a database as well as view them.

## Installation

Rune the following commands to install the right library, then run main.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

After running main.py, the user will be prompted to add a question, print all questions, or quit.
The questions are stored according to the type of question (i.e. multiple choice, fill in the blank, etc.), and the information is saved in a JSON file managed by question database class.
